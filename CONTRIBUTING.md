# Information for contributors

[&#8629; Welcome page][welcome-page]

Great to see you. We would be delighted to have you on board of our development
team! So if you are interested, read on for some information on how to
contribute.

If you don't know what [ELIXIR Cloud & AAI][elixir-cloud] is all about, just
follow the link at the top of the page. Otherwise read on to find out more
about our values and what we can offer you.

## Our values

- **_Openness:_** all of our code is open source, usually from day one, and
  available publicly under a license approved the [Open Source Initiative][osi]
- **_FAIRness:_** we want data, code, analysis workflows and infrastructure to
  be [findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable][fair]
- **_Privacy:_** we believe that sensitive personal data should be under the
  control of the individual and should be shared, processed and analyzed only
  upon and to the degree covered by informed and specific consent, using the
  highest security standards

## Challenges

Here is an incomplete list of some of the challenges that you can sink your
teeth in:

- Aid the **development of consensus-driven community standards** for the
  ethical, secure and efficient sharing and analysis of sensitive data together
  with international partners in big and small public and private
  organizations
- Help to **develop scalable, secure, microservice-based web applications**
  that implement these standards
- Support the **production-grade, containerized deployment** of these services
  on modern infrastructure in public, private and hybrid cloud settings
- Help **design and implement the security features** governing the services
  individually and in combination, including the flow of authentication and
  authorization according to community standards
- **Write high-quality, tested, scalable and secure code** with the goal of
  enabling thousands of professional users in academia, the public healthcare
  sector and industry to analyze sensitive data in a federated cloud
  environment!

## Get involved

### Our offer

We offer you

- to work with us in a thriving and welcoming international
community of experts with diverse backgrounds, including developers, IT
specialists and bioinformaticians
- the opportunity to tackle modern, highly relevant technical challenges on
the way to personalized medicine and other ventures involving the sharing of
big data across national and international boundaries
- support, feedback and appreciation for your work, as well as involvment in
and influence on policy decisions proportional to the level of your
engagement

### Our expectations

We would only expect you to

- please respect our [Code of Conduct][code-of-conduct]
- make an effort to adhere to good coding practices and our [contribution
guidelines][contributing] (we will of course help you with that!)
- communicate clearly and openly with us with regard to any issues that you
take responsibility for, especially if you realize that you cannot or do not
want you to continue with something (which is of course totally fine!)

### Where to go from here

#### Goole Summer of Code

[![logo-gsoc][logo-gsoc]][gsoc]

Apart from casual or regular contributions through this GitHub organization,
we are also a part of the [Global Alliance for Genomics and Health][ga4gh]
[mentor organization][gsoc-ga4gh] during the [Google Summer of Code
(GSoC)][gsoc]. Just follow the link and view the ideas list.

Specifically, the following projects for **GSoC 2020** were proposed by us:

- **Dynamically adding data to DRS**
- **TESK: towards a federated compute infrastructure**

_Feel free to apply - or even propose your own project!_ **(Deadline: March 31
18:00 UTC)**

A previous student has kicked off development of the following project during
**GSoC 2019**:

- [TEStribute][testribute] ([Vani's blog][gsoc-2019-vani])

#### Hackathons

You can also find us frequently at relevant hackathons. Here is a list of
hackathons we currently plan to attend:

- [DDBJ BioHackathon][bh-ddbj] in Hiroshima, Japan: September 6-12, 2020
- [ELIXIR BioHackathon][bh-elixir] in Barcelona, Spain: November 9-13, 2020

We have led projects during the following past hackathons:

- DDBJ BioHackathon 2019 in Fukuoka, Japan
- ELIXIR BioHackathon 2018 in Paris, France
- ELIXIR BioHackathon 2019 in Paris, France

#### Contribute via GitHub

[![logo-github][logo-github]][github]

1. Explore our [project overview][elixir-cloud-projects] page and see if there
is anything that you would like to work on in particular (links to issue boards
are available and most projects should have one or more issues flagged as `good
1st issue`); or perhaps you would like to propose an issue or even a project
yourself?
